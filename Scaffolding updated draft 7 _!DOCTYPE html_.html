	<p> Biography: I am interested in game design. In search of a new beginning, UCF's wonderful academic programs led me to choose UCF as my place of study. Pensacola was where I lived before moving to Orlando to become a student at UCF. I had lived there for a decade and was a Maintenance Engineer for over 3 years.</p>
	<p> My work: I would like to like to design games in the future. I would like to learn how to code and become a 3-d map/environmental game designer using software such as unity and blender. I am also interested in virtual reality as well.<p>
